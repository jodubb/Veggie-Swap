Veggie Swap is an app that allows gardeners and veggie lovers to trade fresh produce with others in their area, no matter the variety. Users can see current transactions, what is available to trade, as well as select the quantity. Once the transaction is complete, they can arrange how they would like to communicate with other gardeners to proceed with the trade. 

Users must create a username and password, then log in if they don't have an existing account with Veggie Swap. Once in, they can view offers and complete their transactions.
